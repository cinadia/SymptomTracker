# My Personal Project

## Do you relate with any of the following?
- experience chronic and/or fluctuating periods of pain or discomfort
- frequently use many remedial services from pain medication to massage therapists to acupuncture
- find it difficult to track the long-term severity of a chronic illness


## Then you need Symmer.

*Symmer* is a symptom tracker for those want a centralized space for tracking their chronic symptoms. 

This project was born out of my own experiences with chronic joint pain, ranging from a TMJ 
disorder to persistent knee and back pain. I wanted to create a centralized location to track
how my discomfort levels were day-to-day, and also note the methods I used to try and combat this 
discomfort. I hope this application can help those struggling with any kind of unwanted symptoms
by giving them a space to track the ups and downs.
